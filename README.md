# Personal Portfolio Website

A minimal personal portfolio website built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This repository contains a small static site (single-page) with the main files `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

## Features

- Responsive single-page portfolio layout (HTML/CSS)
- Interactive behavior implemented in vanilla JavaScript (`script.js`)
- Easy to customize and deploy (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## File structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML page
- `style.css` — Styles for the site
- `script.js` — Frontend JavaScript for interactivity
- `README.md` — Project information and usage (this file)

## How to preview (local)

The site is static — you can open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it from a simple HTTP server for better results (recommended).

Open directly (quick):

1. In your file explorer, double-click `index.html` or
2. Right-click -> Open With -> your browser


## Customize

- Edit `index.html` to change content and sections
- Edit `style.css` to change appearance and layout
- Edit `script.js` to adjust interactive behavior

If you plan to add images, put them in a folder like `assets/` and reference them from the HTML/CSS.

## Deployment

This site can be deployed as a static site. Popular options:

- GitHub Pages: Push to a repository and enable Pages in the repository settings (deploy from `main` or `gh-pages`).
- Netlify / Vercel: Drag-and-drop the `build` folder (or repo) or connect the repo for automatic deployments.

Quick GitHub Pages (one branch):

1. Commit and push `main` branch to GitHub
2. In repository -> Settings -> Pages -> Choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)` -> Save
3. Visit the provided `*.github.io` URL when ready
